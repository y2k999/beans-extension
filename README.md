## :electric_plug: Basical Features
<a href="https://www.getbeans.io/" target="_blank">Beans Framework</a> is a plugin for WordPress that offers a variety of methods to ease the development of themes.
For example, 

 - **Beans Action API** enables you to control WordPress hooks by unique ID.
 - **Beans HTML API** enables you to markup HTML markup, attributes and content output more smartly.
 - **Beans Compiler API** enables you to compile multiple internal or external CSS, LESS and JS files on a per page basis.
 - **Beans Image API** provides you edited images that are created on the fly and cached to ensure fast delivery.

The framework is fragmented into multiple functions which are fired using actions and filters, and this makes your WordPress theme incredibly flexible and easy to customize.

## :electric_plug: Additional Features
In addition to the Beans original features, this enhanced plugin provides several functionalities.
For example, 

 - Manage and organize columns in the posts, pages and users in the WordPress admin panel.
 - Page (Post) view counter for the ability to quickly and easily see how many visitors have accessed your posts.
 - Register/upload several thumbnails for featured images, author profile, no-post image.
 - Automatically generate the featured image from the first image in post or registerd/uploaded library.


## :electric_plug: Note 1

The original Beans Framework uses <a href="https://getuikit.com/v2/" target="_blank">Ukit2</a>, not the <a href="https://getuikit.com/" target="_blank">latest version (3.x) of Uikit</a>, as a css basis.

As Thierry Muller says (:bookmark: https://community.getbeans.io/discussion/uikit-3-2/), UIkit 3 doesn't have backwards compatibility for UIkit 2 which goes against the Beans principals to a certain extent.

In this experimental plugin, you can select Uikit3 CDN option, in addition to the original Uikit2 option.
